            <h1>French Open</h1>
            <h2>Paris, France</h2>
            <p class="intro_text">The French Open (French: Internationaux de France de Tennis), officially known as Roland-Garros, is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks at the Stade Roland-Garros in Paris, France, beginning in late May each year. The tournament and venue are named after the French aviator Roland Garros. The French Open is the premier clay court championship in the world. It is the second of the four annual Grand Slam tournaments. The other three are the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. The French Open is the only Grand Slam tournament currently held on clay. Until 1975, the French Open was the only major tournament not played on grass. Between the seven rounds needed for a championship, the clay surface characteristics (slower pace, higher bounce), and the best-of-five-set men's singles matches, the French Open is generally considered the most physically demanding tournament in the world.</p>

            <h2>Why is the tournament called Roland-Garros?</h2>
            <p >Two years later, French tennis players defeated the United States in the Davis Cup, for the first time in history. As a memorial of this win, France decided to build a tennis stadium and in 1928 the stadium was completed and the authorities decided to name it after their war hero, Roland Garros.</p>

            <h2>My Experience at French Open</h2>
            <p>I just came back to Nice, France where I had a practice camp between Australian Open and French Open and I am starting to feel sick. A week goes by and I am diagnosed with mono. I couldn't practice for 3 months. I was really worried I wouldn't be able to play the two summer Grand Slams. Lukckily I was able to get on court 2 weeks before the French Open starts. I knew that it wasn't enough practice. However, as I get on court and lose my first round singles match in a tight three set battle I wanted to leave and retire my doubles match. Match after match and me and my partenr keep winning. Suddenly, it is Sunday and we are playing the Final of the French Open. Crazy feeling. Next thing I remember, my family is waiting for everyone to leave the stadium so they can take a picture for their memory books!</p>
