            <h1>Australian Open</h1>
            <h2>Melbourne, Australia</h2>
            <p class="intro_text">The Australian Open is a tennis tournament held annually over the last fortnight of January at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia. The tournament is the first of the four Grand Slam tennis events held each year, preceding the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. It features men's and women's singles; men's, women's, and mixed doubles; junior's championships; and wheelchair, legends, and exhibition events. </p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p id="scroll">Before 1988, it was played on grass courts, but since then three types of hardcourt surfaces have been used: green-coloured Rebound Ace up to 2007, blue Plexicushion from 2008 to 2019, and blue GreenSet since 2020. First held in 1905 as the Australasian championships, the Australian Open has grown to become one of the biggest sporting events in the Southern Hemisphere.[3] Nicknamed "the happy slam",[4] the tournament is the highest attended Grand Slam event, with more than 812,000 people attending the 2020 tournament. It was also the first Grand Slam tournament to feature indoor play during wet weather or extreme heat with its three primary courts, Rod Laver Arena, John Cain Arena and the refurbished Margaret Court Arena equipped with retractable roofs.</p>

            <h2>My Experience at Australian Open</h2>
            <p>It is the Wednesday of the second week of the tournament and I am in a bus on my way to the site. The clock is showing 7:15, my warm up starts at 8:30 am. As I am passing the gates and showing my credetials, I feel the tension and pressure before my quarter final match. I am getting ready in the gym and going on court to hit some balls. My match is on court n.3. It is 8:30 am and as I am walking onto the little stadium court, half of the crowd is already there to watch. The warm up went well. As I go back to my locker and prepare for my second round match, refere comes to me and goes "The match before you retire, you have 10 minutes to get on court." I tried to argue with him to give me more time because the court was 15 minutes walking distance. I put on clothes, take my racekts and run to the court. As I am entering the court, the warm up clock is already ticking and I am minutes away from getting my match retired for no show. The stands are full of people waiting to see who I am. That is where I realized that this is going to be one of the hardest matches of my career!</p>
