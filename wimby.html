            <h1>Wimbledon</h1>
            <h2>London, England, United Kingdom</h2>
            <p class="intro_text" id="scroll_less">The Championships, Wimbledon, commonly known simply as Wimbledon or The Championships, is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and is widely regarded as the most prestigious. It has been held at the All England Club in Wimbledon, London, since 1877 and is played on outdoor grass courts, with a retractable roof over two courts since 2019.

                Wimbledon is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, the others being the Australian Open, the French Open and the US Open. Wimbledon is the only major still played on grass, which is the traditional tennis playing surface.
                
                The tournament traditionally took place over two weeks in late June and early July, starting on the last Monday in June and culminating with the Ladies' and Gentlemen's Singles Finals, scheduled for the Saturday and Sunday at the end of the second week. However, changes to the tennis calendar in 2015 have seen the event moved back by a week to begin in early July. Five major events are held each year, with additional junior and invitational competitions also taking place.
                
                Wimbledon traditions include a strict all-white dress code for competitors, and royal patronage. Strawberries and cream are traditionally consumed at the tournament. The tournament allows advertising around the courts only by the official sponsors, which are Rolex, which provides timekeeping technology during matches, IBM, Oppo, Slazenger, and Robinsons barley water.
                
                In 2009, Wimbledon's Centre Court was fitted with a retractable roof to lessen the loss of playing time due to rain. A roof was operational over No. 1 Court from 2019, when a number of other improvements were made, including adding cushioned seating, a table and 10 independently operable cameras per court to capture the games.
                
                Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Championships were cancelled, the first cancellation of the tournament since World War II.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p id="scroll">Club officials considered playing the tournament behind closed doors, but this was ruled out in part because at least 5,000 people–including ballboys, officials, coaches, maintenance, and security–would have still needed to be on site to hold a functioning tournament. Former player and current All England Club board member Tim Henman told the Tennis Channel of the US that the board had carefully considered holding a closed-door Wimbledon. However, the sheer number of people who still would have needed to be on site led the board to realise "that wasn't going to be a workable option".[31] Prior to the start of the 2003 tournament, the club began paying an annual insurance premium of £1.61m ($2 million) to cover losses from cancellation of Wimbledon in the event of a worldwide pandemic as a result of the SARS outbreak; it would receive an insurance payment of £114 million ($141 million) for the 2020 cancellation on expected losses of around £250 million ($312 million).</p>

            <h2>My Experience at Wimbledon</h2>
            <p>It is almost evryone's dream to play at Wimbledon. In 2017, I got into the tournament as a last player. From the second I knew I got in, I was really nervouse. When I entered the site, the first person I met was Roger Federer walking into the locker room with his whole team. That was the first time I saw Roger. In couple days asI am entering the court for my first match on grass, I remember the moment when I first came through the front gates. I was feeling so nervous that I couldn't breathe. I was really tight and couldn't move. The match was a disaster. I learned my lesson and a year later I made it to the 3rd round and final of doubles and went to the championship dinner where I shared tabel with Novak Djokovic.</p>
